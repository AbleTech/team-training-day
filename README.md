###Admin

- To see who you have been paired up with for the challenges, check out [this list](pairing-list.md)
- Although there is an agenda that we would like to ideally stick to, today is about learning, exploring and working as a team. If you want to detour a little from the task in order to achieve these objectives, then that's your call.
- It'd be great if you could provide feedback on the day, so remember this during the day and perhaps collate your thoughts somewhere. This will make sure that we can curate team events that are increasingly what the team want to be doing.


###Code Challenge One (Sudoku Solver):

Everyone loves a good puzzle, and unless you were under a rock in 2005, you would be somewhat familiar with the cult classic the Sudoku. Today, you're going to build a script that will ensure you never fail in completing a Sudoku again - a command line sudoku solver.

Work through the release and see how far you get. Be sure to read through all of [the requirements](1-sudoku/sudoku.rb) before making a start so that you know what you are in for.

###Code Challenge Two (Javascript Racer):

It's time to forget about Sudokus and race off in Javascript fuled racecar. In this next challenge we're going to build a Javascript based speedway game! We'll build a track and two 'cars' will be able to race along it to the finish. We'll only be using HTML, CSS and Javascript (no Coffeescript) in this challenge. It also has an extension element to it. We don't expect you to get there, but if you wizz right through Part One, go ahead and move on.

When you're ready head on over to the [the start line](javascript_racer/javascript_racer.md) and get to it.
